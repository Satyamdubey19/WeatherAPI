# WeatherAPI
A responsive weather forecast web application built with React.js that fetches real-time weather data using a public Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap). Users can search for current weather conditions by city, view temperature, humidity, wind speed, and moreâ€”all displayed with a clean and intuitive UI.
